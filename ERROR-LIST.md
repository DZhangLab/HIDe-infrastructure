- dial unix /host/var/run/docker.sock: connect: no such file or directory
# The linux system could not connect to docker and therefore can't access any files
+ Make sure docker is up and running by using the app 
+ Running the commands `sudo systemctl start docker`
+ Alternatively, you may need to mount the socket but this is the least likely option

- need mac error from katherine
# You have a memory leak somewhere and the docker containers are responding to the commands
# but the containers are not the ones linked to the current batch script
+ Manually delete the docker files by puttind the network down and following the commands here
+ to force stop all containers and force remove all containers
+ https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/
+ Follow up by removing any custom network connections
+ docker network prune
+ You should now be able to put the network up, create correctly linked containers, and access them.
